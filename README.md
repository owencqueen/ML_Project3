## Running the code
Please see the Jupyter Notebook `run_project3.ipynb` in order to run the code. This file will contain any information about running code that is not in the Notebook file.

## Dependencies:
The programs in this repository use the following Python third-party modules:
1. matplotlib
2. numpy

All other modules used are derived from standard libraries included with most Python installations.

## Structure of Repository

## Acknowledgements/ Citations:
The `network_oq.py` file is a modification of a program in Michael Nielsen's "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" textbook. The code that I used was translated by Michal Daniel Dobrzanski into Python 3. The source repository can be found [here](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35).

`util.py` and `mylearn.py` contain code that was written by Dr. Hairong Qi at the University of Tennessee for use in this project.
